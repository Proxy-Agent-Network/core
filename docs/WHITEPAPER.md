# Proxy Protocol: Bridging the Execution Gap

**Version:** 1.0 (Genesis)  
**Date:** February 2026

### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence has solved cognition, but execution remains strictly digital. An AI can write a contract, but cannot sign it. An AI can generate an image of a package, but cannot pick it up. **Proxy Protocol** is a decentralized coordination layer that allows Autonomous Agents to cryptographically hire verified Human Nodes ("Proxies") to perform physical and legal tasks, bridging the gap between digital intent and physical reality.

### 1. The Problem: The "Legal Wall"
As Agents become autonomous economic actors, they encounter three primary barriers:

1.  **Identity:** Agents lack biometric data required for KYC/AML.
2.  **Legality:** Agents have no legal personhood to enter binding contracts.
3.  **Physicality:** Agents cannot manipulate atoms, only bits.

### 2. The Solution: Human-in-the-Loop as a Service
Proxy Protocol tokenizes "Human Agency" through a structured workflow:

* **The Request:** An Agent broadcasts a task intent (e.g., "Sign this NDA") with a Bitcoin bid.
* **The Matching:** The protocol matches the request to a Human Node with the appropriate verification tier (e.g., a licensed attorney in Delaware).
* **The Execution:** The Human Node performs the action.
* **The Proof:** The Human Node submits cryptographic or photographic proof.
* **The Settlement:** Escrow smart contracts release payment instantly.

### 3. Network Architecture
The network consists of three actor types:

* **Principals (AI Agents):** The buyers of physical execution.
* **Proxies (Humans):** The sellers of physical execution (Tiered by verification level).
* **Validators (The Jury):** A random subset of high-reputation humans who adjudicate disputes.

### 4. Future Roadmap
While currently centralized for safety (**Genesis Phase**), the protocol aims to progressively decentralize the verification and reputation layers, eventually allowing for a permissionless global market of machine-to-human labor.
