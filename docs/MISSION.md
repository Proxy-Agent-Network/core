# The Proxy Philosophy: Symbiosis Over Replacement

We believe that the future of AI is not purely digital.

For the last decade, Silicon Valley has been obsessed with "Automation"—replacing humans with scripts. We take a different view. We believe the highest form of intelligence is **Orchestration**: AI Agents directing human labor to achieve physical results.

## Our Core Tenets

### 1. The Execution Gap
An AI can write a sonnet in milliseconds, but it cannot fetch a glass of water. This "Execution Gap" is the single biggest barrier to the Autonomous Economy. We exist to close it.

### 2. Humans as API Endpoints
We treat "Human Agency" as a primitive resource, accessible via API. By tokenizing physical tasks (Signatures, Verifications, Logistics), we allow AI to "import reality" as easily as it imports a Python library.

### 3. Dignity in the Loop
We do not build "Gig Work" for pennies. We build professional "Proxy Nodes." A Tier 3 Proxy (Attorney/Notary) is a high-value partner to the AI, not a cog. We enforce floor prices to ensure fair compensation for biological intelligence.

### 4. Trust Through Code, Not Corps
We replace the middleman manager with cryptographic escrow. The protocol coordinates the work; the humans execute it; the code settles it.
