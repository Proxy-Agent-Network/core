## 1. Abstract
To comply with global 2026 privacy regulations, this proposal mandates a local middleware layer for all nodes that automatically redacts **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** from evidence prior to encryption.

## 2. Mandatory Redaction Targets
Nodes must run an edge-vision model (e.g., MediaPipe or local OpenCV) to mask:
* Human faces (Gaussian blur, 30px minimum).
* Government IDs (excluding the specific fields requested by the task).
* Residential addresses and license plates.
* Financial card numbers (PAN/CVV).

## 3. Compliance Verification
The **Appellate Court** (PIP-015) will audit random encrypted samples to ensure the middleware is active. Failure to redact PII results in a "Tier-2 Violation" and reputation slashing.
