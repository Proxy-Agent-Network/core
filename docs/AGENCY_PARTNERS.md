# Agency & White Label Partner Program

**Status:** Invite Only (Public Access Q3 2026)

Proxy Protocol is designed as a headless infrastructure layer. We empower Dev Shops, Automation Agencies, and Legal Tech firms to build branded "Human-in-the-Loop" products on top of our rails.

---

### The Model: B2B2C
You own the client relationship. We provide the execution.

1.  **Requirement:** Your Client (e.g., a Real Estate Firm) needs a bot to check property mail.
2.  **Request:** Your App calls the Proxy API with `agent_id="your_client_1"`.
3.  **Action:** We execute the task via a verified Human Node.
4.  **Settlement:** We bill you the wholesale floor price.
5.  **Revenue:** You bill the client your retail price + margin.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Partners are issued a **Master API Key** (`sk_live_master_...`) which allows for:

* **Sub-Account Management:** Create isolated environments for each of your clients.
* **Consolidated Billing:** One monthly invoice (in BTC or Fiat via Partner Escrow) for all client usage.
* **Custom Branding:** Whitelabel the SMS/Email templates sent to Human Proxies (e.g., "Task from [YOUR AGENCY NAME]").
