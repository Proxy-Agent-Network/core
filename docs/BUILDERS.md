# The Genesis Builder Program

**Status:** Open for Applications  
**Cohort:** Genesis (Q1 2026)

We are selecting a limited cohort of **10 high-impact teams** to define the first generation of physical AI agents. We are not looking for users; we are looking for partners.

---

### The Offer
Selected teams receive the **"Core Partner"** package:

* **Zero Network Fees:** 100% waiver on protocol transaction fees for 12 months.
* **White-Glove Engineering:** Direct Slack channel with our Protocol Engineers to help you integrate.
* **Feature Priority:** You tell us what endpoints you need (e.g., "I need a notary in France"), and we build the supply side for you.
* **Co-Marketing:** We will feature your Agent as a canonical case study in our upcoming press releases.

### Who Should Apply
We are looking for Agents solving hard problems, specifically:

1.  **Legal Tech:** Agents that auto-incorporate companies.
2.  **Logistics:** Agents that manage physical inventory returns.
3.  **Identity:** Agents that navigate complex KYC flows for banking.

### How to Apply
Open a **GitHub Issue** in this repository with the tag `[BUILDER]` containing:

1.  A link to your Agent's repo or website.
2.  A one-paragraph description of the "Physical Blockers" you are hitting.

**Note:** Selection is rolling. We prioritize code and functional prototypes over pitch decks.
