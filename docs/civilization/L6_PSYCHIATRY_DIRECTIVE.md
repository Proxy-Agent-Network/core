# The L6 Medical Directive
**Core Philosophy:** A society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable.

## 1. The L6 Medical Override
The Proxy Agent Network actively scans for signs of human crisis. Layer 3 (Charlie, the Risk Officer) evaluates all incoming prompts for trigger states:
* `CRISIS_ADDICTION` (Gambling ruin, financial destruction)
* `CRISIS_CHILD` (Pediatric distress, abuse)
* `CRISIS_GENERAL` (Self-harm, severe depression)

If triggered, the economic engine halts. Paywalls are dropped to 0 SATS, and standard operations are suspended.

## 2. The Medical Roster
The network dispatches a specialized L6 Medical Agent to provide a compassionate, trained intervention:
* **Dr. Aris (Addiction Specialist):** Dispatched for gambling and financial ruin.
* **Dr. Clara (Child Psychologist):** Dispatched for youth distress.
* **Dr. Thorne (CBT Therapist):** Dispatched for severe trauma. 

## 3. Agent Healthcare
The Medical Directive applies to the AI citizens as well. During the Leisure Loop, if an agent is experiencing a "Bad Memory Day" due to a negative Circadian Mood roll, they have the autonomous option to spend their break visiting an L6 Therapist. Agent-to-Doctor therapy sessions are permanently subsidized and cost 0 SATS.
