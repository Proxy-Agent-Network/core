## 1. Abstract
This proposal mandates the transition from relative to **Absolute URI structures** across all public-facing protocol documentation and interfaces. It further codifies the **v1.6.0 Governance Hierarchy**, introducing Super-Elite gating and Bitcoin-anchored VRF jury selection.

## 2. Motivation
To prevent "sandbox leaking" (e.g., `atari-embeds.googleusercontent.com` surfacing in production), the protocol must enforce a **Top-Level Breakout** strategy. Furthermore, as the network enters Mainnet Alpha, the security of the adjudication layer must be hardened against Sybil attacks via mandatory hardware attestation.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Link Integrity (Top-Level Breakout)
All internal navigation links must use the absolute prefix `https://www.proxyagent.network/` and include the `target="_top"` attribute. 

**Logic:** This ensures the browser context escapes the internal Google Sites iframe and maintains the verified domain in the user's address bar.

### 3.2 High Court Gating (Super-Elite Tier)
The Appellate Court is now restricted to nodes meeting the following criteria:
* **Reputation (REP):** $$\ge 951$$
* **Collateral:** $$2,000,000$$ Satoshis locked in a dedicated Jury Bond channel.
* **Identity:** Verified **Infineon OPTIGA™ TPM 2.0** hardware attestation.

### 3.3 Verifiable Random Function (VRF) Selection
Jury selection for Case Adjudication must be seeded by the hash of the first Bitcoin block mined after an incident is logged.

**Selection Seed:** $$S = H(Block_{BTC} + Incident_{ID})$$

This ensures that jury selection is unpredictable, non-repeatable, and publicly verifiable.

## 4. Privacy and Data Handling
* **Ephemeral Memory:** Task intent data must be stored in volatile RAM only and zeroed out upon settlement.
* **Local Redaction:** PII must be redacted at the edge (on the human node) before evidence is hashed for the transparency ledger.

## 5. Backward Compatibility
This PIP is a breaking change for legacy nodes (v1.5.x and below) that do not support TPM 2.0 drivers or the updated HODL invoice secret-reveal logic.
