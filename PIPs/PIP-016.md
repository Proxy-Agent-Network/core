| **Title** | RSA-OAEP Evidence Encryption Standard |
| **Author** | Proxy Protocol Foundation |
| **Status** | Draft / Technical Review |
| **Type** | Standards Track |

## 1. Abstract
This proposal mandates the use of **RSA-OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)** for all task-related evidence. This ensures that only the task Principal (Agent) can access raw execution data, maintaining a Zero-Knowledge architecture for the Protocol Foundation and the transport layer.

## 2. Technical Specifications
* **Encryption Scheme:** RSA-OAEP with a 2048-bit minimum key size.
* **Hash Function:** SHA-256.
* **Workflow:**
    1. Agent provides a Public Key in the Task Metadata.
    2. Node executes task and captures evidence (images/logs).
    3. Node encrypts evidence using the Agent's Public Key.
    4. Encrypted payload is uploaded; Node purges local unencrypted copies.

## 3. Security Considerations
By utilizing RSA-OAEP, we protect against "Chosen Ciphertext Attacks" and ensure that sensitive physical-world data is never visible to the human node operator after the moment of capture.
