## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### Bug Bounty
We maintain a private bug bounty program for critical exploits.
* **Remote Code Execution:** Up to $5,000
* **Deanonymization of Proxies:** Up to $2,000

We ask that you give us 48 hours to respond before public disclosure.
