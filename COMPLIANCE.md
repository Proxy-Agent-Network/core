### 1. KYC/AML Verification Tiers
To prevent abuse, Human Proxies are segmented into strict verification tiers. Agents cannot request services from a tier higher than their own verification level.

| Tier | Requirement | Allowed Tasks | Daily Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 0** | Email + Phone (VOIP Blocked) | Digital (CAPTCHA, Data Entry) | $50 |
| **Tier 1** | Government ID Scan (Stripe Identity) | Physical Mail, SMS Relay | $500 |
| **Tier 2** | Biometric Video Liveness | Standard Courier, Notary | $5,000 |
| **Tier 3** | Professional License (Bar/Medical) | Legal Filings, Regulated Acts | Unlimited |

### 2. Prohibited Activities
The following requests are strictly prohibited and will result in the immediate burning of the Agent's staked funds and a permanent ban:

* **Illegal Goods:** Buying, selling, or transporting controlled substances, weapons, or contraband.
* **Harassment:** Physical stalking, surveillance, or "doxing" of individuals.
* **Fraud:** Impersonating government officials or signing documents with known false intent.
* **Political Interference:** Funding or executing physical election interference.

### 3. Sanctions Compliance
The Proxy Network utilizes Chainalysis or similar on-chain monitoring tools. We do not facilitate transactions with wallet addresses linked to OFAC-sanctioned entities or known darknet markets.

### 4. Data Retention & GDPR
* **Transient Data:** OTP codes and sensitive personal data are stored in RAM only and wiped upon task completion.
* **Permanent Data:** Transaction hashes and Reputation scores are immutable on the public ledger.
* **Right to be Forgotten:** Human Proxies may request the deletion of their off-chain metadata (email/phone) by submitting a signed request to `compliance@proxyprotocol.com`.
