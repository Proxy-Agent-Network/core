# Proxy Agent Network: Development Roadmap (2026)

This document outlines the strategic trajectory for the Proxy Agent Network, transitioning from core protocol development to a gamified, decentralized infrastructure.

## Q1 2026: The "Genesis & Engagement" Phase (Current)
* [x] **Core Protocol:** Release v1 API for Human-in-the-Loop task routing.
* [x] **Mission Control v1.0:** Launch of the centralized monitoring dashboard with multi-theme support (Radical Retro, Groovy Greens, etc.).
* [x] **Gamification Engine:** Implementation of XP-based leveling, tiered audio feedback (Sats-based SFX), and achievement badges.
* [x] **Celebratory UI:** Integration of "Magic Marvin" milestone animations and easter-egg interactions.
* [ ] **Lightning Integration:** Finalize micro-payment rails for sub-second Sat settlement.
* [ ] **Python SDK:** Release `pip install proxy-agent` (Alpha) for easier node integration.

## Q2 2026: The "Identity & Trust" Phase
* **Video Authentication:** Real-time deepfake-resistant video challenges for Agents to verify physical presence.
* **Notary API:** Integration with 50-state remote online notarization (RON) providers for legal task execution.
* **Escrow Smart Contracts:** Move from centralized escrow to on-chain DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts) for bid security.
* **Theme Expansion:** Rollout of community-requested styles (Cyberpunk, Vampire Manor, Paperback Noir).

## Q3 2026: The "Decentralization & Scaling" Phase
* **Public Proxy Node Software:** Deployment of "Headless" node software, allowing global users to earn fees by verifying tasks.
* **Reputation Protocol:** On-chain reputation scoring for Human Proxies with slashing mechanics for failed or fraudulent tasks.
* **Global Task Marketplace:** Public order book for complex physical-world tasks (e.g., "Field audit at specific GPS coordinates").

## Q4 2026: The "Governance & Expansion" Phase
* **DAO Transition:** Community voting on fee parameters, achievement rewards, and supported legal jurisdictions.
* **Compliance Layer:** Integration of EU/GDPR and regional legal frameworks for global agent mobility.
* **Marvin AI:** Upgrading Magic Marvin from a static animation to an LLM-powered "System Assistant" for real-time troubleshooting.
