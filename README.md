# Proxy Agent Network: Mission Control

**The decentralized infrastructure layer where Autonomous Agents hire Human Nodes.**

---

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap (2026)

### Q1 2026: The "Genesis & Engagement" Phase (Current)
* [x] **Core Protocol:** Release v1 API for Human-in-the-Loop task routing.
* [x] **Hardware Attestation:** Implementation of "Proof of Body" (PoB) cryptographically binding nodes to physical hardware (NODE_79F9F798).
* [x] **Legal Bridge:** Automated generation of "Proxy Service Agreements" (PDF) for task compliance.
* [x] **Agent SDK:** Prototype `agent_request.py` for autonomous task broadcasting.
* [x] **Mission Control v1.0:** Launch of centralized monitoring dashboard with multi-theme support (Paperback, Business, etc.).
* [x] **Gamification Engine:** XP-based leveling, Sats SFX, and Rival Agent "Chatter" feed.
* [ ] **Lightning Integration:** Finalize micro-payment rails for sub-second Sat settlement.

### Q2 2026: The "Identity & Trust" Phase
* **Video Authentication:** Real-time deepfake-resistant video challenges for Agents to verify physical presence.
* **Escrow Smart Contracts:** Move from centralized escrow to on-chain DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts) for bid security.
* **Theme Expansion:** Rollout of community-requested styles (Cyberpunk, Vampire Manor).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Identity:** HMAC-SHA256 Hardware Attestation (TPM-Simulated).
* **Settlement:** L2 Lightning Escrow with HODL Invoice logic.
* **Compliance:** On-the-fly PDF Power of Attorney generation via jsPDF.
* **Frontend:** Flask-driven Real-time Telemetry (3000ms polling).

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Initialize Node:** `python app.py`
2. **Attest Hardware:** `python attest_node.py`
3. **Run Agent Simulation:** `python agent_request.py`

*Note: Timelines are estimates. Priorities may shift based on Agent adoption and network growth.*
