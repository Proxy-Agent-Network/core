# Governance & Reputation Interaction Review (v1.0)

This document analyzes the alignment between the **AppellateVRF** logic (the Canvas) and the core protocol specifications for Reputation and the Jury Tribunal.

---

## 1. Reputation Tiering Alignment
The `AppellateVRF` class in the Canvas enforces a strict `min_reputation = 950` threshold for High Court eligibility.

* **Interaction:** While `specs/v1/reputation.md` defines the "Elite" tier as any node with a score > 800, the Canvas logic effectively creates a "Super-Elite" or "Supreme" sub-tier.
* **Security Rationale:** During a SEV-1 emergency (as defined in the *Incident Response Playbook*), the network requires maximum anti-Sybil protection. By gating the High Court to the top ~5% of nodes (950+), the protocol ensures that the human judges have significant "reputation skin in the game," making collusion prohibitively expensive.

## 2. Jury Tribunal Escalation
The `AppellateVRF` provides the technical implementation for the policy requirements found in `specs/v1/jury_tribunal.md`.

* **Interaction:** The spec mandates a standard jury of 3 for values under $500, but requires an Appellate Court of 7 jurors for high-value or escalated disputes. The Canvas code implements this exactly via `self.jury_size = 7`.
* **Cryptographic Link:** The VRF output (`vrf_score`) serves as the "Randomness" proof mentioned in Section 2 of the Jury spec. This ensures that even during a "Governance Freeze," the selection of the 7 judges is deterministic and un-gameable once a Bitcoin Block Hash is selected as the entropy source.

## 3. Interaction with Legal Instruments
The Canvas logic acts as the "Validator" for the Limited Power of Attorney (PoA) templates found in `templates/legal/`.

* **Interaction:** A PoA is only legally binding if the "Attorney-in-Fact" (the Human Node) is acting in good faith. The `AppellateVRF` is the mechanism that selects the peers who determine if "Gross Negligence" (as defined in Section 5 of the Delaware PoA) occurred.
* **Proof of Adjudication:** The `vrf_score` generated by the code is intended to be included in the final **Verdict Proof**. This binds the human decision to the hardware-attested execution, completing the "Legal Bridge" loop.

---

## 4. Economic Flow Integration
While not explicitly in the VRF code, the output of the Canvas directly feeds the `jury_bond.py` slashing engine.

* **Interaction:** Nodes selected by the `AppellateVRF` must have a locked bond of 2M Sats.
* **Fee Distribution:** If the 7-person High Court determines a node was fraudulent, the **Consensus Reward** logic is applied to the jurors based on the `vrf_score` ranking to distribute adjudication fees fairly.
