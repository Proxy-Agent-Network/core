# Community Discussions & Governance Guide

Welcome to the Proxy Protocol community forum. This is the place for open-ended discussion, feature requests, and governance debates that are not yet ready for a formal Pull Request.

## 1. Where to Post?

To keep our engineering channels clean, please categorize your post correctly:

| Category | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **💡 Ideas** | "What if the protocol did X?" (Brainstorming new features) |
| **🙏 Q&A** | "How do I install the Node on Windows?" (Community Support) |
| **🗳️ Governance** | Debating active PIPs (Proxy Improvement Proposals). |
| **🙌 Show & Tell** | Show off the Agent or hardware setup you built on Proxy. |
| **💬 General** | Anything else that doesn't fit the above. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT use the "Issues" tab for questions.** Issues are strictly for bug reports and confirmed tasks. Questions posted as Issues will be automatically converted to Discussions by the maintainers.

## 2. Governance Debates (The PIP Process)

Before submitting a formal **Proxy Improvement Proposal (PIP)** via a Pull Request, you must champion the concept here first to ensure community alignment.

1.  **Draft:** Post your idea in the **Governance** category with the prefix `[RFC]` (Request for Comment).
2.  **Debate:** Engage with the community for a minimum of **7 days**.
3.  **Refine:** Incorporate feedback into your technical specification.
4.  **Submit:** Once you have "rough consensus," open a formal Issue using the `governance_proposal` template to move to a formal vote.

## 3. Etiquette

* **Be constructive:** Criticize ideas, not people.
* **Search first:** Duplicate discussions will be locked to keep the conversation centralized.
* **Stay on topic:** Off-topic crypto speculation or price-related discussion is not permitted and will be deleted.
